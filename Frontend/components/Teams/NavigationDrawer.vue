        As Associate Director of Internal Communications and Engagement, Carla
        oversees engagement and communications for Acumen’s community of 350+
        donors and produces major brand and fundraising activations around the
        world--from Palo Alto to London to Nairobi--to elevate and deepen the
        impact of Acumen’s work tackling poverty. Previously at Acumen, Carla
        has managed Acumen’s brand across eight global offices, co-led the roll
        out of Acumen’s rebranding by agency Johnson Banks, and driven grant
        writing and reporting. Carla joined Acumen in 2012 from Vancouver,
        Canada where she spent almost four years as an Associate with Renewal
        Funds to launch Renewal2, a CAD $35 million venture capital fund
        investing in organic food and sustainable consumer goods companies.
        Carla holds a bachelor of business administration degree with a double
        major in communications from Simon Fraser University, as well as an
        honors certificate in sustainability from the Segal Graduate School of
        Business.
